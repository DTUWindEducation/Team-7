#[200~Collaboration discussion:
Discuss: Will you split into subteams? In your subteams, will you pair-program? Meet physically or virtually?

We will split the workload equally and based on each other's best capabilities with coding.There will bee times where we will pair-code and the meetings will be hybrid, sometimes physical and other times virtually if someone's not available 

Discuss: What is your branch structure? One per person? One per subteam?

We are only 3 people, so each branch is considered one subteam as well but we are keeping it flexible cause we are still inÂ theÂ beginning.~
